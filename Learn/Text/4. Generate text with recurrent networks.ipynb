    "Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and their gated cell variants such as Long Short-Term Memory cells (LSTMs) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) provide a mechanism for language modeling &mdash; they can learn word ordering and make predictions for the next word in a sequence. This allows us to use RNNs for **generative tasks**, such as ordinary text generation, machine translation, and even image captioning.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the RNN architecture we discussed in the previous notebook, each RNN unit produced the next hidden state as an output. However, we could also add another output to each recurrent unit, which would allow us to output a **sequence** with the same length as the original sequence. Moreover, we could use RNN units that don't accept an input at each step, instead they take an initial state vector and produce a sequence of outputs.\n",

    "* **One-to-one** is a traditional neural network with one input and one output.\n",
    "* **One-to-many** is a generative architecture that accepts one input value, and generates a sequence of output values. For example, if we want to train an **image captioning** network that produces a textual description of a picture, we can use a picture as input, pass it through a CNN to obtain the hidden state, and then have a recurrent chain generate the caption word-by-word.\n",
    "* **Many-to-one** corresponds to the RNN architectures we described in the previous unit, such as text classification.\n",
    "* **Many-to-many**, or **sequence-to-sequence** corresponds to tasks such as **machine translation**, in which case the RNN first collects all the information from the input sequence into the hidden state, and then unrolls this state into the output sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this unit, we will focus on simple generative models that help us generate text. For simplicity, let's build a **character-level network**, which generates text letter by letter. During training, we need to take a text corpus, and split it into letter sequences. \n",

    "We've introduced one more parameter called **temperature**, which indicates how strongly we should choose higher probability characters over lower probability ones. If the temperature is close to 0, we choose the highest probability character, and when the temperature approaches infinity then all probabilities become equal, and we randomly select the next character. In the example above we can observe that the output becomes meaningless when we increase the temperature too much, and starts cycling when we lower it closer to 0. "
